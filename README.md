# Simple Management App

This is a simple management app built using Mantine for UI with MobX for state management and Supabase as the backend service.
The app is developed with React and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Allows searching by all available parameters or criteria.
- **Sorting:** Enables sorting data based on specific conditions or fields.
